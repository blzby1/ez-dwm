# ez-dwm

An easy way to install dwm and other suckless tools right after installing Arch Linux.

# Usage

Make sure you are using the bash shell and are on Arch Linux.

## info

Basically just installs some xorg packages, sets up dwm, st, and dmenu. There is also a little thing that makes adding users easier.

I got really bored of having to do these steps over and over again, so this just automates the process.
