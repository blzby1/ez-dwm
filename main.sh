# If you somehow don't have bash, please install it. It's a little something guys like me in the tech world call a "dependency"
# Also, if you get a "command not found" error, then please install that using "sudo pacman -S (command, or package that contains it)"
# No, I don't know why I'm making this so user-friendly.
